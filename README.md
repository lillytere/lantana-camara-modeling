# lantana-camara-modeling

Code for predicting spatio-temporal patterns of *Lantana camara* using satellite and in situ data.

### Based on the manuscript:
**Synergistic Use of Satellite, Legacy, and In Situ Data to Predict Spatio-Temporal Patterns of the Invasive *Lantana camara* in a Savannah Ecosystem**

## Notes

- This project includes multiple scripts and components. Only the main script is provided here, but you can access the corresponding Earth Engine repositories and publicly available assets via the links below.
- The code references Earth Engine **assets** (e.g., image collections, shapefiles, training data). These are **not all public by default**.
- To use the script with your own data, please:
  - Replace asset paths (e.g., AOI, training data, imagery)
  - Adjust date ranges, study area, and model parameters as needed

## Earth Engine Repository

You can run the project directly in Earth Engine using this shared repository:

ðŸ”— https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/lillyschell7/LC_SDM_supplementary_material

This repository includes:

- `SDM_Lantana_2023/`: Main species distribution model script for *Lantana camara*
- `Soil_Data/`: Soil variables used as model predictors
- `Topographic_indices/`: Elevation-derived indices
- `Watermask_2023/`: Water mask for preprocessing
- `vegetation_indices/`: Scripts for calculating NDVI and other indices

## Additional Assets

These asset collections are also  part to the original script:

- **Sentinel-1 (SAR)**:  
  [Speckle-filtered SAR data](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?asset=users/lillyschell7/Sen1_speckle_filtered)

- **Sentinel-2 (spectral composites 2015â€“2023)**:  
  [Preprocessed imagery](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?asset=users/lillyschell7/Spectral)
  
- **Terra climate dataset (preprocessed dataset 2015â€“2023)**:  
  [Preprocessed imagery]([https://code.earthengine.google.com/?asset=users/lillyschell7/Spectral])
